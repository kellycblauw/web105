    <!-- TITLE & SUMMARY -->
    <h1>Titanic Review</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The <b>Titanic</b> directed and written by <em>James Cameron</em> is about a
        a woman, Rose, retelling the story of her time aboard the ship, Titanic. She tells a story of great
        adventure, love and death that spanned her 3 days spent on the great ship which abruptly
        ends before their arrival to America. Rose luckily made it to tell her story, but many lives
        were lost when the ship sank after colliding with a glacier.</p>

    <p>Rose is beckoned by a search team that is looking for a lost piece of jewelry after she
        insists the special necklace once belonged to her. Once Rose meets with the team, she
        begins recalling those precious and saddening moments.

<h3>Love and Loss</h3>
<p>The <b>Titanic</b> is about more than just a voyage interrupted by chaos, but it is a modern
    day <i>Rome and Juliet</i> love story. Rose comes from a wealthy family, and is set to marry
    a man within her social class. This is not at all what Rose actually wants for herself, but she
    is pressured by her mother to further secure their wealth. Rose can't stand the pressure or lack
    of choices she is left with and intends to take her own life until Jack stumbles upon the scene.</p>
<p>Jack comes to the rescue and talks her off the ledge in a smooth and calculated way. This
    begins the start of their love story. Their connection is apparent through their dialogue
    and in the way the film is shot. It does a wonderful job of showing how their relationship
    develops, even with the obstacles thrown in their way. Jack is from the lower class, and only
    ended up aboard the Titanic by chance. Their differences matter not to Rose, and she pursues
    him regardless. Throughout the movie, Jack takes Rose on a wild adventure and she gets to
    experience a different life. Rose and Jack only knew eachother for a few days, but he would end
    giving his life for hers when the Titanic inevitably sinks.</p>
<p>These experiences changed Rose. Jack showed her she could be anything she wanted, and she
    ultimately chooses a different life. She vividly expresses her gratitude for this in this quote
    from the Titanic, "A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. But now you know there was a man named Jack Dawson
    and that he saved me... in every way that a person can be saved." It may seem like she is speaking literally, but it
    is clear that she is also addressing her way of life. Rose is shown safely in America after being
    rescued, and she intentionally avoids her mother - clearly indicating she will not be returning
    to that life. At the end of the movie, the famous necklace, Heart of the Ocean, is returned to
    Rose and she tosses it right back into the ocean where it belonged. The necklace represented
    that old life she wittingly left behind and it would have to stay there.
