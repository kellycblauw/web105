            <figure class="right"><img src="succ1.jpg" alt="succulent"></figure>
            <p>Succulents are a group of plants that store water in their leaves, stems or their roots.</p>

            <p>Succulents are resistant to drought, and can survive in conditions with very little humidity.
                While they can withstand a lack of water, they do need sunlight to survive and they
                even change color with lack of sunlight.
            </p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://www.succulentsandsunshine.com/what-are-succulents/">Succulents
                    and Sunshine</a>, Most succulents prefer warm temperatures and are not able to withstand
                freezing. Due to the water stored in their leaves, freezing will often result in the plant dying or
                getting mushy leaves.</p>
