            <h3>LIGHT</h3>
            <p>Most succulents require at least half a day of sunlight. In
                very hot areas, some shade may be recommended. If your succulents
                aren't getting enough sun, they will actually begin to grow and
                stretch in order to find more light. It is also useful to rotate your
                succulents frequently to ensure the entire plant is getting enough
                sun and it will help it to stand straight.
            </p>

            <h3>WATER</h3>
            <p>When watering your succulents, pour water directly into the soil until it
                runs through the drainage holes. Do NOT use a spray bottle for watering
                succulents, as it can lead to moldy leaves and frail roots. Allow the soil
                to dry slightly between waterings.
            </p>

            <h3>SOIL</h3>
            <p>Succulents require good draining soil. If you're planting is pot or
                container, you will want to make sure your planter has draining holes.
                You can also incorporate sand with your soil, or place crushed rocks at
                the bottom of the container to promote better drainage.
            </p>

            <H3>PLACEMENT</H3>
            <P>Succulents are often crammed together in little planters or containers,
                but this creates an overcrowded environment for the little plants and will
                likely lead to mold or insect infestations. Additionally, it will
                make it harder for each of the plants to survive on limited food and water
                they'll be sharing in the little space. You can easily remove and replant
                your succulent in a spacious environment.
            </P>

            <p>As far as plants go, succulents are among the easier to care for. There
                are plenty of different types with a broad range of shape and color, so
                you will definitely be able to find one that appeals to you.
