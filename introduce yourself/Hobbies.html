            <p>Typically, most days after work you can find me either walking or playing outside with my dogs, then
                spending the evening relaxing playing video games, painting or watching some tv. I also enjoy hanging
                out with my friends and doing our makeup. I really enjoy doing halloween makeup with
                special effects, like blood or scars.
            </p>

            <p>My friends and I get together once a week to play Dungeons and Dragons. My boyfriend, Ryan, introduced me
                to the game a few years ago, and I've been obsessed ever since. We play very long campaigns so the
                stories
                become very special to us and it makes playing so much fun. I highly encourage anyone and everyone to
                step
                out of their comfort zone and try it!
