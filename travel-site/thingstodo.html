            <h2>The Lord of the Rings</h2>
            <p>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was filmed entirely in New Zealand.</p>
            <p>Fans of The Lord of the Rings can visit several locations in Wellington such as, the Shire, Gardens of
                Isengard,
                Rivendell, Osgiliath Wood, and the Paths of the Dead.
            </p>
            <p>Fans can visit the real Village of Hobbiton in the Shire, as it remains as a permanent attraction. Other
                locations can also be found throughout New Zealand, but not all are as accessible as Hobbiton.

            <h2>Māori Culture</h2>
            <p>Tourists can see Māori culture close up and even participate in special ceremonies to experience their
                traditions
                for themselves.</p>
            <p> You can also visit the marae, the Māori neeting grounds. According to <a
                    href="https://www.newzealand.com/ie/geothermal/">100%
                    Pure New Zealand</a>, "A visitor who has never set foot on a marae is known as waewae tapu or sacred
                feet. They must partake in a formal
                welcoming ceremony, called a pōwhiri, to remove the tapu (sacredness) and become one people with those
                of
                the marae." Even if you choose not to participate in these traditions, you will likely come across a
                marae as you make your way through New Zealand. </p>

            <h2>Volcanic & Geothermal Nature</h2>
            <p>In the Rotorua areas, tourists can watch boiling mud pools and geysers with heat beneath their feet
                from the ground filled with steam. According to <a href="https://www.newzealand.com/ie/geothermal/">100%
                    Pure New Zealand</a>, "Minutes from the city centre, geysers of boiling water roar from the
                ground
                and pools of bubbling mud gurgle and belch." There are plenty of walkways that offer easy acces and
                views of this interesting bit of nature.

            <h2>Whale Watching</h2>
            <p>Tourists can visit Auckland and watch whales in their natural environment in the Hauraki Gulf Marine
                Park.
                Whales aren't the only wildlife visitors can expect to see here as "over 25 of the 37 southern
                hemisphere
                marine mammals have been identified in the area, which makes up almost a third of
                the world’s population of these species", according to <a
                    href="https://www.newzealand.com/ie/geothermal/">100%
                    Pure New Zealand</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Kaikoura is one of the one places in the world where you can see sperm whales. According to <a
                    href="https://www.newzealand.com/ie/geothermal/">100%
                    Pure New Zealand</a>, "Whales thrive
                close to Kaikoura because of its unusual submarine landscape. The continental shelf drops quickly into a
                number of extremely deep underwater canyons. In addition, a warm current from the north meets a colder
                one from the
                south. This causes nutrients from deep within the ocean to be carried upward, a phenomenon that helps to
                support all
                types of marine life from plankton and krill to dolphins and whales."</p>
